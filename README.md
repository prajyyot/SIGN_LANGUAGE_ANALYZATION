# Sign-Language-Recognition

Hand gesture is a image processing recognition system in artificial intelligence and machine learning universe.
I performed the technology of hand gesture recognition by considering the americal sign language.

The hand gesture recognition is performed by use of CV2 of Open CV.
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.

To perform Open CV, i have done importing Hand Detector from cvzone.Hand Tracking Module.

The performing module accurately traces the hand cordinates and describes it's american sign language meaning.
