# Sign-Language-Recognition

Hand gesture is a image processing recognition system in artificial intelligence and machine learning universe.
I performed the technology of hand gesture recognition by considering the americal sign language.

The hand gesture recognition is performed by use of CV2 of Open CV.
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.

To perform Open CV, i have done importing Hand Detector from cvzone.Hand Tracking Module.

The performing module accurately traces the hand cordinates and describes it's american sign language meaning.

1] Project Title:
Sign Language Analysis Using Computer Vision
2] Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a system that detects and interprets hand gestures corresponding to American Sign Language (ASL) using computer vision techniques. This aims to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.
3] Technologies Used:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, cvzone, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy
•	Hardware: Standard Webcam for capturing hand gestures
4] Methodology:
1.	Hand Gesture Recognition: Implemented an image processing recognition system for sign language interpretation using AI/ML.
2.	OpenCV Integration: Used OpenCV (cv2) for hand tracking and image processing.
3.	Hand Tracking: Imported the Hand Detector from cvzone.HandTrackingModule to accurately detect and track hand coordinates.
4.	Data Preprocessing: Captured hand gestures, applied cropping, resizing, and transformations for better model training.
5.	Classification Model: Utilized a deep learning classifier (cvzone.ClassificationModule.Classifier) trained on ASL hand gestures.
6.	Real-Time Detection: Implemented a system that recognizes hand gestures in real-time and displays the corresponding ASL meaning.
5] Output & Results:
•	The system successfully detects and classifies ASL hand gestures in real-time.
•	Recognized signs are displayed on the screen with bounding boxes around the detected hand.
•	The classifier predicts the sign with high accuracy using a trained model.
6] Challenges Faced:
•	Background noise affecting hand detection accuracy.
•	Variations in hand positioning, lighting conditions, and occlusions.
•	Optimizing the model for real-time performance.
7] Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates real-time sign language recognition using computer vision and deep learning. The system efficiently detects hand gestures and maps them to ASL characters, making communication more accessible.
8] Future Scope:
•	Expanding the dataset to cover more sign language gestures.
•	Enhancing model accuracy using advanced deep learning techniques.
•	Deploying the system as a mobile or web application for broader accessibility.
